### Notes:

Nice work Alex!

- the code is well formatted and organized
- the code comments are a great way to describe what the code is doing
- the code works as expected
- use the 'defer' attribute on the script element. This allows the html to load fully before loading the javascript file

```js
<script src='client.js' defer></script>
```
