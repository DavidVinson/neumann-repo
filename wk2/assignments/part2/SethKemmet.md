### Notes:

Q1: Good description of the code, but also needed to describe the code as it would run. ex, which console.log statement will executed? Q2: Good description of the code. What would be the logged value of 'secret' if this code was executed? Q3: Good description of the code. What would be the logged value if this code was executed?

- provide the expected outcome of questions 1-3

- Q6: That's a good way to look at the fix for Q6, but a more direct way without altering the if statement would be swapping the console.log statements. It's tricky b/c of the way the comparison operation is written. I would agree, that it is written in a way that makes the condition confusing.

- let and const are both scope level variables. 'let' will allow reassignment, where 'const' the variable cannot be reassigned. I typically declare variables with 'const' until I need the code to reassign the variable.

Overall, the descriptions of the code was good. What was missing was describing what would happen if the code was executed.
