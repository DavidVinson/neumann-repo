### Notes:

- in conditional statements using the equality operator, get into the habit of using '===' vs '=='. The '===' is the strict equality operator and is a safer way to make a comparison. the '==' is also an equality operator, but it coerces a match.

```js
if (luckyNumber == 2 && adventurous) {
  diceRoll = 'Roll the dice!';
}
```
