### Notes:

- it's recommended to use single quotes for javascript and double quotes for html; not a big deal as the code will work with double quotes.

- in conditional statements using the equality operator, get into the habit of using '===' vs '=='. The '===' is the strict equality operator and is a safer way to make a comparison. the '==' is also an equality operator, but it coerces a match.

- adventurous === true results in true === true which results in true, so just writing 'adventurous' as the condition is shorter way of writing it. (For functionality, there is nothing wrong with your code, just something I thought might be interesting to you.)

```js
result = adventurous ? 'Adventures are great!' : 'How about we stay home?';
```

### Notes:

Nice work Alex! The code is well structured and formatted; makes for easy to read code.

- committing more often, or after a piece of code is working as expected, it is good practice to commit the changes. The message for any given commit could just be what was done. for example, git commit -m "created a fullName variable to concatenate firstName and lastName".
