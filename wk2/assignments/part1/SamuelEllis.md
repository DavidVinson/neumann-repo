### Notes:

- a variable only needs to be declared once.

- the parenthesis are not needed to declare a variable:

```js
let adventurous = true;
```

- #3: Create a third variable called `fullName` by combining `firstName` and `lastName`

```js
let fullName = firstName + '' + lastName;
console.log(fullName);
```
