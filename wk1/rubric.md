Hey \_\_\_. Welcome to week 1 feedback!

To set a little context, even if everything is amazing, we always give feedback on how we think you could improve - there's no such thing as perfect code, and there's always room for improvement.

### Notes:

This is really good! I'd strongly recommend committing more often. Every time you get something new working (probably every 30 minutes or so), make a commit. You're saving your progress so that if something goes wrong, you can go back!

We also love giving feedback on things you are curious about, so feel free to throw questions you have into the comments on your assignment.

Great work!
