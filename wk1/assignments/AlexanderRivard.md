Hey Alexander. Welcome to week 1 feedback! (3)

To set a little context, even if everything is amazing, we always give feedback on how we think you could improve - there's no such thing as perfect code, and there's always room for improvement.

### Notes:

All looks good! The formatting of the files (html, css) are neat and readable. Formatting makes a big difference in trying to troubleshoot missing element tags, etc.

Javascript: get into the habit of using ";" semi-colon at the end of javascript statements. ex,

```js
console.log('hello world');
```

HTML: nice use of a cloud link for the image! to use stored picture in the project, we would need to use a relative path to the image.

CSS: an alternative to styling the <li> elements, one could style the <ul> that would cascade to each <li>. How the code is right now is just fine, but just anther option.

### Notes:

This is really good! I'd strongly recommend committing more often. Every time you get something new working (probably every 30 minutes or so), make a commit. You're saving your progress so that if something goes wrong, you can go back!

Yes, the additional files are necessary, but not critical at this point. We'll discuss those files as we progress.

Great work!
