Hey Seth. Welcome to week 1 feedback! (3)

To set a little context, even if everything is amazing, we always give feedback on how we think you could improve - there's no such thing as perfect code, and there's always room for improvement.

### Notes:

Javascript:

- nice work with the javascript file and using the semi-colon ";" at the end of the console.log statement. this is usually missed.

HTML:

- nice job sourcing the image; using the relative path.

| General Items                  | Complete? |

| The assignment repo was forked |    yes    |
| The correct repo was turned in |    yes    |

### Notes:

This is really good! I'd strongly recommend committing more often. Every time you get something new working (probably every 30 minutes or so), make a commit. You're saving your progress so that if something goes wrong, you can go back!

The code is well formatted and readable! VS code has a built-in formatter (Shift + option + F). There are other third-party formatter such as Prettier which do a really nice job, just takes some initial setup.

- try out the built-in formatter on the on the style.css file!

Great work!
