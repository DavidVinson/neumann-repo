Hey Jenny. Welcome to week 1 feedback! (3)

To set a little context, even if everything is amazing, we always give feedback on how we think you could improve - there's no such thing as perfect code, and there's always room for improvement.

### Notes:

Javascript:

- get into the habit of using ";" semi-colon at the end of javascript statements. ex,

```js
console.log('hello world');
```

HTML:

- typically white space is ignored in html. the <h1> element could then be written as <h1>Jenny Lagervall's Week 1 Assignment!<h1> . Using spaces does not make for bad code, it is just not recognized by html.

```js
<header>
  <h1> Jenny Lagervall's Week 1 Assignment! </h1>
</header>
```

[reference MDN: white space in html](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Whitespace#html_largely_ignores_whitespace)

- nice use of a cloud link for the image! to use stored picture in the project, we would need to use a relative path to the image.

CSS:

- an alternative to styling the <li> elements, one could style the <ul> that would cascade to each <li>. How the code is right now is just fine, but just anther option.

### Notes:

This is really good! I'd strongly recommend committing more often. Every time you get something new working (probably every 30 minutes or so), make a commit. You're saving your progress so that if something goes wrong, you can go back!

Great work!
