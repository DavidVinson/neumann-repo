### Notes:

Nice work!

- I'm being nitpicky here, but naming convention for functions is camelCase, but naming convention for React Functional Components is MyComponent(), ie first letter capitalized
- the code has increased in complexity, but it is functioning as expected. keep paying attention to errors and Describe, Isolate, and Fix one problem at a time.
- keep up the good work and all the effort!
