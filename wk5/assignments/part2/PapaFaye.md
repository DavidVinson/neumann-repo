### Notes:

It's good to keep up with css, it's the first thing people see in an app!

### CSS

- format html, css and javascript.
  files helps make the code easier to read and identify poor file structure (Shift + Option + F)

- class names use lower case

```
.Jaynu-Record-Shop{
    text-align: center;
    color: rgb(215, 251, 239);

}
```

- the relative path to the 'record.png' is "./record.png". All the files are in the assignment folder, so they are at the same level.
