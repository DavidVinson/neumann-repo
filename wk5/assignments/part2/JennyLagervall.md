### Notes:

All good! It's good to keep up with css, it's the first thing people see in an app!

- could use more frequesnt code commits and descriptive commit messages

### CSS

- although this works, class names use lower case

```
.RecordShop{
  text-transform:uppercase;
   color: #e7eaf6;

}
```
