### Notes:

Nice work!

- way to get into bootstrap
- the code demonstrates breaking down functionality into components
- was good to see the front-end page navigation
- look to update the README w/ base project info
- there are opportunities to push yourself to practice CRUD, strive to attempt more stretch goals, this will only help, even if not achieved.
