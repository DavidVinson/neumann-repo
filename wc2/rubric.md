### Notes:

EXAMPLE NOTES: The above items are things that employers will look for when browsing your GitHub page. I would recommend going back and adding more code comments and updating the README to include a description of the project in your own words. Please use `option-shift-f` to indent your code. It's much easier to follow when you can see what is nested.
