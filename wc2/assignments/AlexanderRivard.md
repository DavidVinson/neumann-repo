### Notes:

Nice work! The code demonstrates a solid understanding of the HTTP response cycle

- EVENT -> STATE -> RENDER
- using GET and POST HTTP actions in communicating via HTTP with a server
- configuring a server to listen for requests from a client(s) and provide a response and possibly requested data
